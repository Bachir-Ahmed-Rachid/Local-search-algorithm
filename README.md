# Local-search-algorithm
Local search algorithm applied in python (Scheduling of a critical machine case study)

This is an implementation of the local search algorithm applied to Scheduling of a critical machine.

in this study we want to order the execution of n tasks on a single machine. Let pi,ri and di processing time, availability date and
the expired date of task i respectively. The problem is to schedule tasks 1, 2, . . . , n in order to respect the availability dates while minimizing the maximum delay.
